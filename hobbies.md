        My passion for performance has spanned the past 11 years. As an amateur tuba player, I have represented my alma maters—Central University of Finance and Economics, Beijing No. 166 High School, and Shijia Primary School—in numerous national competitions, winning multiple gold awards.

        Although I have long since retired from the stage, I remain deeply grateful to my former bandmates and my tuba instructor, Professor Fu. I also cherish the masterpieces I once performed, including <em>《The Rite of Spring》</em>, <em>《The Firebird》</em>, <em>《Pirates of the Caribbean》</em>, <em>《Pictures at an Exhibition》</em>, and <em>《The Gadfly Suite》</em>.
