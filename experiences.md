        Cross-Asset Volatility Forecasting Framework: Formulated and validated the hypothesis of "volatility spillover from S&P 500 implied volatility to cryptocurrency markets." Integrated S&P 500 volatility surface features as exogenous macro risk factors with BTC Level-1 order book data to construct a hybrid-signal forecasting model, significantly enhancing strategy performance during macro-event days.

         S&P 500 Volatility Surface Modeling & Factor Extraction: Processed 4 years of European option data to calibrate an Arbitrage-Free Implied Volatility Surface using the SSVI model and Differential Evolution (achieving WRMSE < 0.006). Extracted ATM Variance and Skew as key macro sentiment indicators to serve as inputs for downstream predictive models.

         BTC Volatility Prediction & ML Implementation: Cleaned 60,000+ hours of BTC order book data to engineer 30+ Alpha signals, fusing macro factors with micro-structure features (e.g., Order Book Imbalance). Trained a LightGBM model optimized via Optuna (Bayesian optimization) to forecast 24-hour rolling Realized Volatility, achieving an out-of-sample Information Coefficient (IC) of 0.54 and validating the efficacy of cross-market signals.
