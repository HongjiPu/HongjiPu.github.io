<img src="avatar.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Hongji Pu** [(JP, 蒲洪基)](https://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/hc663).
<br>
I began in Pure Finance, grasping the essence of capital with solid project experience. But understanding the 'what' wasn't enough; I needed the 'how.' This drive led me to Financial Engineering, where I mastered the mathematical models that price risk.
<br>
Yet, the pursuit of rigor didn't stop there. I pushed further into the frontiers of Computer Science—not to follow a trend, but because I believe the future belongs to those who control the system's underlying logic.
